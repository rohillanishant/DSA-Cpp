4th February 2023:
1) a = false -> ~a  = -1 but how to get 1 here like negation of 0 is 1 but we are getting -1, do hit and trial and try to know whether we can get ~0 as 1 or not.
2) Why can't we confidently say that in right shift operator , we can not say that it is always divide by 2? and why can we say that in left shift it is always multiply by 2
3) int a = 5; why is the output of (++a) * (++a) = 49. Use the concept of precedence in this
4) Search what can be given inside the expression of switch i.e. float,string,statement,character,number? Explore them

6) Using global variable is a bad practice. Why?

5th February 2023:
1) Can we create more than one main function in a single program?
2) Can we return 1,-1 in the main() function?

5) Function to display area of circle
6) Number is odd or even
7) Factorial of number
8) Number is prime or not
9) Print all prime numbers from 1 to n

11) Reverse an integer
12) Set the ith bit
13) Convert celsius to fahrenheit.

8th February 2023:
1) Reverse an integer
2) Set the ith bit
3) Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
4) Why there are infinite number of set bits in the negative number?

10th February 2023:
1) Find out what is the use of memset function.
2) int arr[10] = {0}; -> All the values are initialized to 0
   int arr[10] = {1}; -> All values won't be initialized to 1. Find using memset how to initialize with 1 or any particular value other than 0.
3) Implement swap function on your own way. (3 ways) --> Find all.

11th February 2023:
1) Try union of two arrays with duplicate cases (Using intersection logic, mark common elements as INT_MIN and then use if condition).

3) Try to solve (Will be done in class as well)
  i) left rotate array by one element
  ii) majority element in array
  iii) buy and sell stock - 1

12th February 2023:
